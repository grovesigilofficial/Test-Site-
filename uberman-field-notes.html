  <h2>The Experiment</h2>
  <p>I began the Uberman sleep schedule — six 20-minute naps across 24 hours, bypassing normal circadian cycles. After 36–48 hours, the nervous system enters a crucible: it feels like the skull has been opened. By day three — <em>Uberman Hell</em> — few persist.</p>

  <h2>Observations</h2>
  <p>After ~2 days, REM onset is immediate. Naps become vivid, dense, and electric: lucid dreams, telepathy, direct restorative cycles without light sleep. Energy work stabilizes hormones; vitals remain sharper than standard sleep patterns.</p>

  <h2>Intent</h2>
  <p>This is not rebellion but collaboration with nature — interfacing with REM as a technology. Full documentation and social platform will appear once the site launches.</p>
